      <ul>
        <li>The shop and all instruments inside are fully insured and all work is warrantied. Estimates are provided in person and free of charge. Appointments are required as this is a one-man shop. I carry a small selection of D'Addario strings. If you have a preference beyond this you are free to bring your own or have me order them for you. Bench minimum is $125 and this covers the labor on most set-ups.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Set-ups</b> - Adjust the relief in the neck, cut the nut slots to the correct width, depth and angle, make sure the saddle is fitted flush to the bottom of the bridge saddle slot for acoustic instruments for good tone transfer, adjust action and intonation at the saddle, polish the frets and dress the ends as necessary, wax or oil the board, tighten hardware and clean and adjust electronics.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Refrets</b> - Replace all or some of the frets where there is limited fret height from previous leveling or from heavy play wear. In instances where all frets are removed, there is the option to level and radius the board as necessary prior to new frets being installed. I offer traditional nickel silver and EVO gold.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Fret Dress</b> - In leiu of a refret, level and crown frets where there is ample fret remaining resulting in clean notes across the board.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Neck Resets</b> - Offered on Martin (and Martin-style) acoustic guitars built with a dovetail joint. When there is less than ideal saddle height and the action on the instrument is too high, a neck reset may be the recommended course of action. This involves removing the neck, resetting the angle in the dovetail joint, and reassembling. When appropriate I use traditional hide glues.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Nut and Saddle Fabrication</b> - I typically use bone (bleached or unbleached) and micarta or ebony when period correct and requested.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Binding repair and replacement</b> - Reglue loose binding that has separated from the body. When binding has broken off or separated too dramatically for reattachment, I will remove and replace with the preferred material.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Pickup Installation</b> - On both electric and acoustic guitars. Routing and custom wiring available. I am an authorized dealer for Dimarzio, EMG, LR Baggs and K&K.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Structural and Crack Repair</b> - Cracks are aligned, glued and cleated for lasting structural integrity. Sometimes light finish touchup is appropriate.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Bridge Repair and Fabrication</b> - In situations where the bridge has separated from the top, as happens from top warpage or string tension over time, the bridge is removed, refitted and reglued. If necessary a new bridge can be fabicated from rosewood or ebony to match the correct style and size.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Bridge Plate Repair</b> - Over time, bridge plates can wear. When possible I will plug the holes in the plate with the correct maple or rosewood depending on the original material and redrill for a clean and lasting anchor for the ball ends of the strings. If the wear is too extensive for plugging a new bridge plate can be fabricated and installed.</li>
