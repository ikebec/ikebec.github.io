        <li><b>Refrets</b> - Replace all or some of the frets where there is limited fret height from previous leveling or from heavy play wear. In instances where all frets are removed, the board will be leveled and radiused as necessary prior to new frets being installed. We offer traditional nickel silver, EVO gold and stainless steel wire.</li>

        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Structural and Crack Repair</b> - Cracks are aligned, glued and cleated for lasting structural integrity.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Bridge Repair and Fabrication</b> - In situations where the bridge has separated from the top, as happens from top warpage or string tension over time, the bridge is removed, refitted and reglued. If necessary a new bridge can be fabicated from rosewood or ebony to match the correct style and size.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Bridge Plate Repair</b> - Over time, bridge plates can wear. When possible we will plug the holes in the plate with the correct maple or rosewood depending on the original material and redrill for a clean and lasting anchor for the ball ends of the strings.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Neck Resets</b> - Offered on Martin acoustic guitars built with a dovetail joint. When there is less than ideal saddle height and the action on the instrument is too high, a neck reset may be the recommended course of action. This involves removing the neck, resetting the angle in the dovetail joint, and reassembling. In general we use traditional hide glues.</li>
