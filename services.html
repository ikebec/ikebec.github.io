    <p>Our focus is on bringing each instrument to its optimal playing performance. Each instrument is different and requires a different set of considerations, adjustments and repairs to bring the best out of it. While we perform all kinds of modifications and enhancements to the instruments we work on, our direction is to ascertain what the instrument was built to do, understand your style and preferences as a player and then to perform the highest quality repairs to accomplish our goals.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>We only use the premier components when doing electrical repairs and modifications, quality wood on structural repairs, and the best bone we can find for nuts and saddles. We stock StringJoy and GHS strings, CTS, Switchcraft and CRL electrical components, Gavitt wire, StewMac bone and fret-wire and select Gotoh hardware. Other parts can be ordered on request. We perform set-ups, refrets, neck resets on Martin style instruments, electronics repair and modifications, pickup installations, nut and saddle fabrication, bridge and bridge plate repair and replacements, binding repair and structural/crack repairs.</p>
