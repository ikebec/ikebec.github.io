      <ul>
        <li><b>Set-ups</b> - Designed to get your instrument playing to your specifications and preferences. This involves adjusting the relief in the neck, cutting the nut slots to the correct width, depth and angle, making sure the saddle is fitted flush to the bottom of the bridge saddle slot for acoustic instruments, adjusting action and intonation at the saddle, polishing the frets and dressing the ends as necessary, waxing or oiling the board, cleaning all electronics and tightening hardware.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Refrets</b> - Replace all or some of the frets where there is limited fret height from previous leveling or from heavy play wear. In instances where all frets are removed, the board will be leveled and radiused as necessary prior to new frets being installed. We offer traditional nickel silver, EVO gold and stainless steel wire.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Fret Dress</b> - In leiu of a refret, dressing frets where there is ample fret remaining creates level, smooth, and accurately crowned frets resulting in clean notes across the board.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Neck Resets</b> - Offered on Martin acoustic guitars built with a dovetail joint. When there is less than ideal saddle height and the action on the instrument is too high, a neck reset may be the recommended course of action. This involves removing the neck, resetting the angle in the dovetail joint, and reassembling. In general we use traditional and accurate hide glues.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Pickup Installation</b> - We are authorized dealers for Seymour Duncan, Dimarzio, LR Baggs, and K&K.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Nut and Saddle Fabrication</b> - We use bone (bleached or unbleached) and micarta when period correct and requested. When fabricating we create the correct string spacing, nut slot width, depth and angle for your string choice, and saddle shaping for clean break angles and resonant tone.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Bridge Repair and Fabrication</b> - In situations where the bridge has separated from the top, as happens from top warpage or string tension over time, the bridge is removed, refitted and reglued. If necessary a new bridge can be fabicated from rosewood or ebony to match the correct style and size.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Bridge Plate Repair and Replacement</b> - Over time, bridge plates can wear. When possible we will plug the holes in the plate with the correct maple or rosewood depending on the original material and redrill for a clean and lasting anchor for the ball ends of the strings. If the string holes in the plate are heavily damaged and plugging is not possible then replacement of the plate is necessary.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Binding repair and replacement</b> -  Reglue loose binding that has separated from the body. When binding has broken off or separated too dramatically for reattachment, we will remove and replace with the preferred material.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Electronics Repair and Modifications</b> - Our preferences are for vintage-style electronics. We use high quality pots, wiring and capacitors in our work. We do not work on circuit boards or create custom wiring diagrams.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Structural and Crack Repair</b> - Cracks are aligned, glued and cleated for lasting structural integrity.</li>
