    <h2>Repair Services</h2>
    &nbsp;
    <div class="list">
  <ul>
    <li>Luthier owned and operated. The shop and all instruments inside are fully insured and all work is warrantied. Estimates are provided in person and free of charge.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
</div>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Set-ups</b> - Adjust the relief in the neck, cut the nut slots to the correct width, depth and angle, make sure the saddle is fitted flush to the bottom of the bridge saddle slot for acoustic instruments, adjust action and intonation at the saddle, polish the frets and dress the ends as necessary, wax or oil the board, clean all electronics and tighten hardware.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Refrets</b> - Replace all or some of the frets where there is limited fret height from previous leveling or from heavy play wear. In instances where all frets are removed, there is the option to level and radius the board as necessary prior to new frets being installed. On maple boards this would require refinish work. We offer traditional nickel silver, EVO gold and stainless steel wire.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Fret Dress</b> - In leiu of a refret, level and crown frets where there is ample fret remaining resulting in clean notes across the board.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Pickup Installation</b> - Offered on electric and acoustic instruments.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Nut and Saddle Fabrication</b> - I typically use bone (bleached or unbleached) and micarta or ebony when period correct and requested.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Binding repair and replacement</b> -  Reglue loose binding that has separated from the body. When binding has broken off or separated too dramatically for reattachment, I will remove and replace with the preferred material.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Electronics Repair and Modifications</b> - My preference is for vintage-style electronics. I use high quality pots, wiring and capacitors in my work. I do not work on circuit boards or create custom wiring diagrams.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Structural and Crack Repair</b> - Cracks are aligned, glued and cleated for lasting structural integrity.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Bridge Repair and Fabrication</b> - In situations where the bridge has separated from the top, as happens from top warpage or string tension over time, the bridge is removed, refitted and reglued. If necessary a new bridge can be fabicated from rosewood or ebony to match the correct style and size.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Bridge Plate Repair</b> - Over time, bridge plates can wear. When possible I will plug the holes in the plate with the correct maple or rosewood depending on the original material and redrill for a clean and lasting anchor for the ball ends of the strings.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Neck Resets</b> - Offered on Martin (and Martin-style) acoustic guitars built with a dovetail joint. When there is less than ideal saddle height and the action on the instrument is too high, a neck reset may be the recommended course of action. This involves removing the neck, resetting the angle in the dovetail joint, and reassembling. In general I use traditional hide glues.</li>
