      <div class="description">
        <p>The tone across the body is rich and warm with great sustain and clarity. Great playability with low action and a flat board. This model has a tight, straight grain German spruce top, Indian rosewood sides, Honduran cedar neck and an ebony board.</p>
        <p>This guitar has been upgraded with a new hand-cut bone saddle and nuy - done aftermarket and in-house by myself.</p>
        <p>Additionally, it has been given a proper fret dress and is playing very nicely.</p>
        <p>Comes with a weaved hardshell case (a button missing, shown in pictures) with internal humidity meter to help you keep this in great shape for a long time.</p>
        <p>Has a light 'Used' stamp on the back of the headstock and a sticker over the serial number inside the guitar. Other than that, it's in perfect condition, please see the pictures.</p>
